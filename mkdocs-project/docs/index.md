# Open Water Foundation / Learn Twitter #

This documentation provides resources to learn more about Twitter and the standards for using Twitter in a professional manner, as well as how to use [Twitter API](/twitter-api.md) to post tweets either through writing custom code or by using a library. Libraries are available for several coding languages, but most of the examples in this documentation will be using the library [twitterOAuth](https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth) since this library is simple to understand and can be used to show basic examples. Examples can easily be applied to other libraries.

This documentation has been written based on research on Twitter and Twitter API done at Open Water Foundation.
