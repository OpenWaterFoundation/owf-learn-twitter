# Twitter Mobile Notifications

Open Water Foundation hopes to adapt a new way of connecting with followers and allow them to receive notifications directly to their phones. This can be accomplished using Twitter's mobile notifications.


## Direct Messages/Updated Statuses
Twitter allows users to receive mobile notifications to your phone for a number of different reasons. To edit your mobile notifications on Twitter Desktop go to **Settings and Privacy** > **Mobile** and then you can select various text notifications you wish to receive.

For the sake of receiving important alerts from an organizational account the two options you might want to turn on are **Tweets from people you've enabled for mobile notifications** and **Direct Messages**.

After selecting **Tweets from people you've enabled for mobile notifications** navigate to the organizations page you wish to receive updates from. Once there select the three dots next to **Following** and select **Turn on mobile notifications**.

Now you will receive text notifications of any direct messages or updates from the organization or user profile you turned on mobile notifications from.

## Customizing Mobile Notifications
There are multiple ways to customize notifications separate from the default notifications, sounds, or vibrations on a phone, depending on the operating system of that phone.

The first step before proceeding with any of these devices is to save the default Twitter number in your contacts.

#### iPhone:
1. Go to the Contacts app (which may be hidden in an automatically created folder) and select on a person's name.
2. In their contact details, press **Edit** in the top right corner.
3. Scroll down until you see **Ringtone** and **Vibration**. Tap on either option to select which sound plays and the pattern of vibration for when this contact calls.
4. Below this, you can repeat the process for messages, by selecting **Text Tone and Vibration**.

#### Android:
This process varies slightly depending on the phone's manufacturer and the software installed. In some examples it may also vary depending on whether you are using the default messaging app, or a custom app such as textra.

1. Go to your Contacts app (which might be labelled People) and select a contact.
2. In contact details, hit the menu button (three vertical dots in the top-right corner) and choose **Edit** (this step may be unnecessary on your phone). You may also find **Edit** in the top-right corner to begin with.
3. Scroll down until you see **Ringtone**, **Message tone**, and **Vibration Pattern** (you may have to select the drop down menu **View more**). Tap it and select a tone to play when they call.
