## Accounts

* Account identifiers are usual a short string such as `flast` (first initial, last name),
`FirstLast`, `orgabbrev` (organization abbreviation), or other variations.
* Accounts are indicated by `@account` in tweets.
The tweets are received by accounts that "follow" the account or because of
settings on the Twitter account that send a digest to the user on daily, weekly, or other timeframe.
* The use of social media and Twitter benefits from thoughtful use
of accounts, hashtags, format, and attachments.

## Tweets

* Tweets are only consumed by Twitter users that follow the sender's account.
* Tweets are are up to 280 characters that are sent from the account to the public twitter world.
	+ A tweet can also contain attachments such as images.
	+ A tweet can contain URLs to point to other content.
* Tweets can contain "hashtags" of format `#topic` and multiple hashtags
can be embedded in a tweet.
	+ Hashtags are used to group, search, and filter tweets.
	+ Whereas accounts can be controlled by the account owner,
	hashtags can be used by anyone.

## Direct Messages
