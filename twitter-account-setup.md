# Twitter Accounts Set Up
TriLynx Systems is in the process of setting up a business twitter account to communicate and notify users with important, up-to-date, statuses. The following is suggested best practice for working with a new twitter account for business.

## Create a Test Account
TriLynx Systems is currently working on adapting new code for posting automatic updates to the TriLynx Systems twitter account. When developing new tools it is a good idea to create a test account for testing purposes. With a test account you can post updates to Twitter and ensure that no body can see them.

#### Create a Test Account:
Create a test account similar to creating a typical user account:

1. Go to [https://twitter.com/signup](https://twitter.com/signup)
2. Enter the required information:
	* **Full Name**: This will be the display name for the test account. Since the test account is designed to never be viewed by the public, this can be anything. For example, "TriLynx Systems Test".
	* **Phone or Email**: It is a good idea to create a fake email to be associated with the test account. It is suggested to make the email the same as the account name so that it is easier to remember. For example, if planning on using the twitter handle @TriLynxTest, create an email such as trilynxtest@gmail.com. This is only for convenience purposes, you can use any valid email for the test account.
	* **Password**: Enter in a password you can remember.
3. Enter a valid phone number. Twitter requires an account be verified with a valid phone number before allowing access to many developer features, such as gaining access to [OAuth keys] **//TODO:** Add a link to OAuth keys when you get a chance.
4. Create a user name/twitter handle for the account. As with the Full Name for the account it will not matter much in the end since twitter users cannot see this.

#### Protect Your Updates:
Since a test account is set up with the intent of working through bugs, you don't necessarily want all tweets being public. Any tweets posted will only display to those you approve.

To avoid people coming across test status updates:

1. Click on the user image or `Profile and Settings`
2. Select `Settings and privacy` from the drop-down.
3. Select `Privacy and safety` from the left hand navigation bar.
4. Check the box next to `Protect your Tweets`. This will prevent any future tweets from being available publicly.

## Create Official Business Account
Once any bugs have been worked out through the test account, an official account will need to be set up for full deployment. Creating an official account is the same process as with the test account, except this information will need to be acceptable for official business.

To create a business account:

1. Go to [https://twitter.com/signup](https://twitter.com/signup)
2. Enter the required information:
	* **Full Name**: There is a 50 character limit. This will be the display name for the test account. This should be relevant to your business name. Don't use numbers and avoid underscores. For example, "TriLynx Systems".
	* **Phone or Email**: This will be the official email associated with your business account.
	* **Password**: Enter in a password you can remember.
3. Enter a valid phone number. Twitter requires an account be verified with a valid phone number before allowing access to many developer features, such as gaining access to [OAuth keys] **//TODO:** Add a link to OAuth keys when you get a chance.
4. Create a user name/twitter handle for the account. As with the Full Name this should be relevant to the business name and similar to the display name you have chosen. Again avoid numbers, and underscores. Use the upper case  naming convention. For example, @TriLynxSystems 

## Managing Accounts Through Tweet Deck
Tweet Deck offers the ability to connect separate twitter accounts without having to share any passwords among the separate users. 

**Tweet Deck Teams**: allows multiple users to share a Twitter account without having to share the password.  
There are 3 different Roles associated with Tweet Deck Teams:

1. **Owner**: 
	* Can manage password, phone number, and login verification.
	* Can invite others to access the account as admins or contributors.
	* Can take action on behalf of the team account (Tweet, Retweet, Direct Message, like, etc.), schedule Tweets, create lists, and build collections.
2. **Admin**: 
	* Can invite others to access the account as admins or contributors.
	* Can take action on behalf of the team account (Tweet, Retweet, Direct Message, like, etc.), schedule Tweets, create lists, and build collections.
3. **Contributer**: 
	* Can take action on behalf of the team account (Tweet, Retweet, Direct Message, like, etc.), schedule Tweets, create lists, and build collections.
